# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

My motivation for this project was to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Day.js and also a Weather API to create a weather dashboard that lets you type in a city and it will give you the current and also the 5 day forecast for that City. The dashboard will also keep previous entered cities in your history. This solves a problem of having to search around the web for the weather and also as it keeps the history of cities it also saves you the time of re-entering locations that you like to check the weather of often.
